    <h1><blockquote>Advanced CSS Learning</blockquote> </h1>
    <blockquote>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</blockquote>

    <h2><blockquote>Why Learning CSS</blockquote></h2>
    <blockquote>Many older websites that were built without CSS prove difficult to redesign. But once a site is built with CSS hooks, it can be redesigned very quickly. Changing things like the colors and backgrounds refresh how a site looks with very little effort. In fact, many sites now put up special versions of their sites for special occasions and they can do this because it only takes a few hours to create an alternate stylesheet for the occasion.</blockquote>
